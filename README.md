A fast-paced fighting game where players take control of unique gladiators, mastering combos and strategies to conquer their opponents in the arena. With an innovative combo system and a focus on scalability, UMG challenges players to create seamless combat sequences while maintaining fluid gameplay.

## Making of â€“ Ultimate Martial Gladiators:
Including implementations for every single programming pattern in the book Game Programming Patterns, UMG is a personal project, developed solo using Unity and C#, aimed at building a challenging, expandable codebase inspired by the book Game Programming Patterns and advanced C# courses. This project emphasizes clean code architecture and practical application of advanced programming concepts to deliver a polished and maintainable game.

UMG serves as both a technical learning journey and a platform to explore creative game mechanics, including a dynamic combo system built from scratch to empower game designers with easy editing tools.

## Technical Highlights:
All Game Programming Patterns Applied: Each core system was built using different architectural patterns from Game Programming Patterns by Robert Nystrom, offering practical insights into scalable game development.

- C# Code Architecture: Heavily focused on Clean Code and SOLID principles, ensuring maintainability and scalability for future updates.

- Tree Node Combo System: Developed using a node tree data structure, allowing for dynamic and efficient combo creation. This system minimizes memory usage, speeds up combat sequences, and provides game designers with user-friendly tools to modify combos.

- No Plugins Used: All gameplay systems were built from the ground up, emphasizing hands-on learning and deep technical understanding.
